To be able to run the system, open the file "rule_inducer.pl" in an text editor and 
set the absolute path to data_f in the "setup" predicate, see example below.

setup:-
    working_directory(_,'c:/your path here/data_f').

Then load rule_inducer.pl into the SWI-prolog environment. 
Remove comments (%) from data set(s) to choose which data set to run. 
Default is only the iris data set.
Start the system by typing "start." from the command prompt. 
The results will be printed in a file "Result" in the data_f directory.
    

Best regards,
